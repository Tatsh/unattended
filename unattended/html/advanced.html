deployment system</a>.

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This document describes advanced configuration options for the
Unattended system.  These options will make using the system more
convenient, but they are not mandatory.

<p>This document is divided into:
<ol>
<li><a href="#basic">Basic customizations</a>
<li><a href="#answer-file">Details of the answer file</a>
<li><a href="#advanced">Advanced configuration</a>
</ol>

<h1 id="basic">Basic customizations</h1>

<p>Unattended's master installation script reads one or more prototype
<code>unattend.txt</code> files, asks a few questions, then merges all
of this information into a generated <code>unattend.txt</code> file to
direct the OS installation.

<p>The script first reads <code>z:\doslib\unattend.txt</code> to
gather an initial collection of default settings.  You should not need
to edit this file.

<p>Next, the script reads <code>z:\site\unattend.txt</code>, if it
exists.  So to perform simple customizations, just create and populate
<code>z:\site\unattend.txt</code>.  The values you put there will
override the defaults and cause the installation script to skip any
corresponding questions.  Do not worry about creating a "complete"
answer file; if you fail to provide some required value, the
installation script will prompt you for it.

<p>A complete description of <code>unattend.txt</code> is <a
href="#answer-file">below</a>, but here is a simple example to get you
started.

<p>Suppose you want to use the same organization name, product key,
domain name, domain joining account, and time zone for multiple
installations.  You would put these lines into
<code>z:\site\unattend.txt</code>:

<pre>
[UserData]
    OrgName="FooBar, Incorporated"
    ProductKey=XXXXX-YYYYY-ZZZZZ-00000-11111

[Identification]
    JoinDomain=FOOBAR
    DomainAdmin=FOOBAR\wsadmin

[GuiUnattended]
    ; U.S. Pacific
    TimeZone=004
</pre>

<p>The installation script will skip all of the corresponding
questions, but still ask you (e.g.) for the password to the
<code>FOOBAR\wsadmin</code> account.  You can pre-record that too by
setting the <em>DomainAdminPassword</em> key, if you do not mind
having the password on the network in cleartext.

<p>Note that the installation script tries hard to preserve comments,
so feel free to use them liberally.

<h1 id="answer-file">The <code>unattend.txt</code> file</h1>

<p>To become a true master of unattended installation, you need to
become familiar with the nuances of <code>unattend.txt</code> files.

<h2>Quick reference</h2>

<p>The basic syntax of <code>unattend.txt</code> is pretty simple; it
is a collection of [<em>section</em>] headers and
<em>key</em>=<em>value</em> pairs.  Lines starting with semicolon are
comments.  See the default <a
href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/unattended/unattended/install/doslib/unattend.txt?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup"
>unattend.txt</a> file for an example.

<p>Most of the master installation script's questions are simply
providing values for certain required keys.  These keys include:

<dl>
<dt><em>[UserData] FullName</em>
<dd>The full name of the user.

<dt><em>[UserData] OrgName</em>
<dd>The organization name of the user.

<dt><em>[UserData] ComputerName</em>
<dd>The name of the computer.  A value of "*" tells
<em>Windows&nbsp;Setup</em> to pick a random name.

<dt><em>[UserData] ProductKey</em>
<dd>Your 25-character Windows XP software license key, just as it
appears on the license.  For Windows 2000, this variable is named
<em>ProductID</em>.

<dt><em>[GuiUnattended] AdminPassword</em>
<dd>The password for the local Administrator account.

<dt><em>[GuiUnattended] TimeZone</em>

<dd>The time zone setting.  This is a numeric value; see the <a
href="timezones.html">table of index numbers</a> for a complete list.
The default value for Unattended is 35 (U.S. Eastern).

<dt><em>[GuiUnattended] AutoLogon</em>

<dd>If set to "yes", Setup will patch the registry to logon
automatically as Administrator, skipping the logon screen, at every
reboot.  This setting is useful for automatically doing other things
once the OS install is done.  You can use the <a
href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/unattended/unattended/install/bin/autolog.pl?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup"
>autolog.pl</a> script in <code>Z:\bin</code> to enable or disable
this registry setting after the OS is installed.

<dt><em>[Identification] JoinDomain</em>
<dd>If present, tells Setup to join this computer to a domain.

<dt><em>[Identification] DomainAdmin/DomainAdminPassword</em>

<dd>These work in conjunction with <em>JoinDomain</em>.  They specify
the domain account and password to use to join the computer to the
domain.  Note that <em>DomainAdmin</em> must be in fully-specified
<code>DOMAIN\user</code> form.  (The installation script will take
care of this for you.)

<dt><em>[Unattended] OemPnpDriversPath</em>

<dd>Specifies additions to the search path for Plug&amp;Play drivers.
Elements of this path are separated by semicolons.  Windows uses this
path when searching for a driver for a piece of hardware.  These paths
are relative to the <code>C:</code> drive, and are usually used in
conjunction with the <a href="os.html#drivers"
><code>$oem$/$1</code></a> mechanism.

<dt><em>GuiRunOnce</em>

<dd>This section lists one or more commands to run the first time a
user logs into the machine following the OS installation.  In
conjunction with the <em>AutoLogon</em> key, this is the hook we use
to install hotfixes and applications after the OS installation
finishes.  Unattended puts the single command
<code>c:\netinst\postinst.bat</code> here, which is a batch file
generated by the installation script.

</dl>

<p>These are just a few of the important keys; there are others, but
many of them are optional.

<h2>Microsoft's documentation</h2>

<p>The most thorough documentation for the answer file is Microsoft's
own, but unfortunately, it is a bit annoying to obtain.  There are
different versions for Windows 2000 and Windows XP, although the
answer files are very similar.

<dl>
<dt><em>Windows 2000 Guide to Unattended Setup</em>

<dd>Unfortunately, as far as I know, you cannot download this document
directly; you must first download and install the <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/downloads/servicepacks/sp3/supporttools.asp"
>Windows 2000 SP3 Support Tools</a>, then use Internet Explorer to
extract the <code>unattend.doc</code> file from the
<code>deploy.cab</code> archive.  You can also find
<code>deploy.cab</code> on the Windows 2000 CD in the
<code>support\tools</code> folder.

<dt><em>Microsoft Windows Preinstallation Reference</em>

<dd>This document is also unavailable for direct download.  You must
first download the <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/WindowsXP/pro/downloads/servicepacks/sp1/deploytools.asp"
>Windows XP SP1 Corporate Deployment Tools</a>, also known as
<code>deploy.cab</code>.  Then use Internet Explorer to extract
<code>ref.chm</code>, a Windows Help file, which you can double-click
to browse.
</dl>

<p>(Personally, I find the Windows 2000 Word document easier to read.)


<h1>Advanced configuration</h1>

<p>(If you do not know Perl, you should probably just skip this
section.)

<p>After reading <code>z:\doslib\unattend.txt</code> and
<code>z:\site\unattend.txt</code>, the installation script will
<b>execute</b> the file <code>z:\site\config.pl</code>, if it exists.
This file is a snippet of Perl code which can set any values it wants
based on any criteria it wants.  It can even use the built-in routines
to read and parse additional <code>unattend.txt</code> files.  In
short, it can pretty much modify the behavior of the installation
script in an infinite variety of ways.

<p>But I am tired of writing, and I really want to get this release
out the door.  So full documentation for this section will have to
wait.
