<h1>Overview</h1>

To perform an unattended installation of Windows NT, 2000, or XP, you
need to:

<ol>
<li><a href="#install-share">Create the OS distribution point</a>
(basically, a folder holding a copy of the Windows CD-ROM)

<li><a href="#bootdisk">Obtain access to that distribution point</a>,
and your hard drive, from DOS

<li><a href="#go">Format the disk, create the <em>unattend.txt</em>
file, and run <em>i386\winnt.exe</em></a> from the distribution point

</ol>

<h1 id="install-share">Creating the OS distribution point</h1>

<p>Although you can use a CD-ROM or local disk directory, we are going
to create a network distribution point because it's more fun.

<h2>Creating the \\ntinstall\install share</h2>
<p>Copy the <em>install</em> directory tree from this project's
distribution to a Windows file server (say, a Unix box running <a
href="http://www.samba.org/">Samba</a>), and export it read-only with
guest access permitted.  The sample scripts, and this documentation,
assume that this share is named <em>\\ntinstall\install</em>.  In
other words, the name <em>ntinstall</em> is an alias for the file
server and the share is named <em>install</em>.  If you want to use
different names, that is OK, but you will need to modify the scripts
to refer to it (search for "ntinstall").

<p>Some parts of the install share (like <a
href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/">DJGPP</a>) are required but not
included, so you will need to download them yourself.  See the
<em>README.txt</em> file in the install directory for details.

<h2>Copying the Windows CD-ROM to the share</h2>
<p>Next, copy the <em>i386</em> folder from the Windows CD-ROM to the
appropriate subdirectory of the install share.  For example, for
Windows 2000 Service Pack 3, copy the <em>i386</em> folder to
<em>\\ntinstall\install\win2ksp3</em>.

<h2>Applying the service pack, if any</h2>

<p>(Note: This step is optional; you can apply a service pack along
with all the other hotfixes later.  But combining the service pack
into the distribution point now will make installation faster.)

<p>To apply the service pack to the installation point, use the
"slipstreaming" feature introduced with Windows 2000 Service Pack 1
(but not supported by NT).  You can learn about this in detail by
reading Microsoft's <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/downloads/servicepacks/sp3/spdeploy.htm">
Installation and Deployment Guide</a> for Win2k SP3, but the process
is pretty simple:

<ol>

<li>Run <kbd>w2ksp3.exe&nbsp;/u&nbsp;/x:c:\sp3</kbd>.  (w2ksp3.exe is
what you get when you download the Service Pack from Microsoft).  This
extracts the service pack to <em>c:\sp3</em>.

<li>Run
<kbd>c:\sp3\i386\update\update.exe&nbsp;/s:\\ntinstall\install\win2ksp3</kbd>.
This applies the service pack to the distribution point, creating the
"slipstreamed" Win2k SP3 tree.  Due to a bug, you must be a local
administrator for this to work, even if the distribution point is on a
remote share.  (Otherwise, <em>update.exe</em> will fail with
"permission denied".)

</ol>

<h1 id="bootdisk">Obtaining access to the distribution point from
DOS</h1>

<p>The goal here is very simple: To boot to DOS and mount
<em>\\ntinstall\install</em> as the <em>Z:</em> drive.

<h2>Using the unattended.sourceforge.net bootdisk</h2>

<p>The <em>bootdisk</em> directory from this project's distribution is
dedicated to helping you create a bootable DOS disk with networking.
Simply <kbd>cd&nbsp;bootdisk</kbd> and run <kbd>make</kbd> to generate a
bunch of floppy disk images in the <em>images</em> subdirectory.

<p>There will be one floppy image for each supported network driver;
you will need to use the image with the right driver for your network
card.  If you are not sure which driver is right, you may need to try
them all (but see below about <a href="#netboot">booting from the
network</a>).

<p>For instructions on adding new drivers and other information on
customizing the bootdisk, see the <em>README.txt</em> file in the
bootdisk directory.  Note that the <em>template</em> subdirectory
holds the canonical copy of the tree which is copied to the bootdisk.
To see for yourself (or modify) what the bootdisk will do, start with
the <em>autoexec.bat</em> file in that directory.

<p>Once you have chosen the correct floppy image, you will need to
write it to a floppy.  How you do this depends on your operating
system; on Linux, something like
<kbd>dd&nbsp;if=e100b.img&nbsp;of=/dev/fd0</kbd> will do the trick.

<h2>Booting from CD-ROM or network</h2>

<p>These sections are optional; you can kick off the installation
process just using a floppy.  But a CD-ROM is faster, and it can hold
ALL of the floppy images at once.  And "nothing-but-net" installs are
the most fun, although I still find them a little creepy.  Still, you
should probably skip these sections the first time through.  Once you
have the whole process working from floppy, moving to a CD-ROM or
network boot is pretty easy.

<h3>Booting from CD-ROM</h3>
<p>To boot from a CD-ROM, we will use the <a
href="http://syslinux.zytor.com/iso.php">ISOLINUX</a> and <a
href="http://syslinux.zytor.com/memdisk.php">memdisk</a> utilities
from the excellent <a href="http://syslinux.zytor.com/">SYSLINUX</a>
package.  (Do not be fooled by the name; SYSLINUX is a very powerful
boot loader whose use goes far beyond Linux.  It is perfect for this
application, for example.)  Download the SYSLINUX package, and copy
the <em>isolinux</em> and <em>memdisk</em> applications to the
<em>iso</em> directory.  Then type <kbd>make iso</kbd>.  You should end
up with a <em>bootdisk.iso</em> image, suitable for burning to a
CD-ROM.  Booting this CD-ROM will give you a choice of "virtual
floppies" to boot; choose the one with the right driver for your
network card.

<h3 id="netboot">Booting from the network</h3>

<p>Most modern network cards support booting directly from the network
according to Intel's Preboot eXecution Environment (PXE)
specification.  You can download the PXE specification from <a
href="http://www.intel.com/labs/manage/wfm/wfmspecs.htm">Intel's WFM
site</a>, but the basic idea is simple: Just configure your DHCP
server to provide "filename" and "next-server" DHCP options giving to
the file name and TFTP server of the PXE boot loader.

<p>Which boot loader?  We will use <a
href="http://syslinux.zytor.com/pxe.php">PXELINUX</a>, also from the
SYSLINUX package.  This will work just like the ISO CD-ROM boot, using
<em>memdisk</em> to load a virtual floppy, but here you do not care
which network driver to use!  3com has kindly written a "universal"
DOS network driver which runs over any PXE implementation, allowing
one floppy image to support any PXE-compatible network hardware.

<p>NOTE: Historically, by which I mean as recently as this year, PXE
implementations have been extremely buggy.  Always flash the firmware
on your network card to the latest version before attempting a network
boot.  For network hardware embedded on a motherboard or laptop, this
probably means flashing the system BIOS.

<p>In the <em>bootdisk</em> directory, type
<kbd>make&nbsp;tftpboot</kbd>.  This will populate the tftpboot
directory with everything you need; just copy it to /tftpboot on your
TFTP server, set up your DHCP server as described above, and you
should be good to go.

<h1 id="go">Formatting the disk, creating unattend.txt, etc.</h1>

<p>The bootdisk's entire purpose in life is to obtain access to the
network, then hand off control to the more powerful tools available
there.  In particular, the bootdisk mounts
<em>\\ntinstall\install</em> as the <em>Z:</em> drive, then executes
the Bourne shell script <em>z:\install.sh</em>.

<p>The install.sh script will help you partition the drive and format
it.  It will ask you which script to run after the OS installation is
finished; this is the hook by which the <a
href="apps.html">application installation</a> process is kicked off.

<p>Finally, <em>install.sh</em> will copy the sample
<em>z:\unattend.txt</em> file to the <em>c:\</em> drive and offer to
let you edit it.

<p>The <em>unattend.txt</em> file, also known as the "answer file", is
the key to this whole process.  Normally, Windows Setup tosses up lots
of dialogs to ask you questions ("what is your name?", "what is your
license key?", etc.) during the OS installation.  By passing the right
flags to <em>i386\winnt.exe</em>, we will cause Setup to consult this
file for its answers instead.

<p>The best documentation for this file is Microsoft's own "Microsoft
Windows 2000 Guide to Unattended Setup".  (I strongly recommend that
you read it, or at least browse it, before proceeding.)
Unfortunately, as far as I know, you cannot download this document
directly; you must first download and install the <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/downloads/servicepacks/sp3/supporttools.asp"
>Windows 2000 SP3 Support Tools</a>, then use Internet Explorer to
extract the <em>unattend.doc</em> file from the <em>deploy.cab</em>
archive.

<p>Once you understand it, editing <em>unattend.txt</em> is pretty
easy.  And once you have edited it, you can select "Install now" to
run the <em>i386\winnt.exe</em> program with the appropriate
arguments.

<p>Congratulations, your unattended Windows OS installation is on its
way!
