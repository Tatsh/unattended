<i>The two basic principles of Windows system administration:</i>
<ul>
<li><i>For minor problems, reboot</i>
<li><i>For major problems, reinstall</i>
</ul>

<hr>

<h1>What is this?</h1>
<p>This is a project for Unix systems administrators living in a
Windows world.  It will teach you how to boot from a floppy (or
CD-ROM, or directly from the network), answer a few questions, and
come back two hours later to a fully-installed Windows workstation,
using nothing but Unix servers on the back end.

<p>But be warned: This is not a
<kbd>./configure&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;make&nbsp;install</kbd> kind of
project.  This is a set of instructions, tools, and sample scripts
which will require some customization for your site.  Nevertheless,
everything you need to know, or at least a reference to it, is here
somewhere.  If not, let me know; all suggestions and contributions are
welcome.

<h1>Where did it come from?</h1>

<p>In my (ever reluctant) experience with Windows, I have found that
the more recently a machine was installed, the better it works.  So I
decided to look for ways to make the installation process routine.

<p>This led me into the strange and quirky world of DOS networking,
<code>.bat</code> scripts, <code>unattend.txt</code> files, network
booting, and the amazingly under-documented silent installation
procedures for various Windows applications.

<p>Microsoft has their own solution to this problem, involving things
like <a
href="http//:www.microsoft.com/windows2000/technologies/directory/ad/"
>"Active Directory"</a> and <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/en/datacenter/help/sag_RIS_Default_topnode.htm">"RIS"</a>
and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/smserver/">"SMS"</a>.  If you
think those sound like good ideas, then you are not part of this
project's intended audience.

<p>Some approaches to this problem involve drive imaging (also known
as "cloning").  This project is not one of them.  Workstation cloning
has several drawbacks, including <a
href="http://service2.symantec.com/SUPPORT/ghost.nsf/docid/1999050308324125"
>the SID issue</a>, poor support for non-uniform hardware, poor
maintainability, and large, bulky images.  Even minor hardware
variations, or minor updates to the software configuration, can cause
major headaches.  On the other hand, if you need to crank out a large
number of completely identical workstations, drive imaging is very
easy to set up.  And products like <a
href="http://www.symantec.com/sabu/ghost/">Ghost</a> and <a
href="http://www.powerquest.com/driveimage/">Drive&nbsp;Image</a> make
it very easy.

<p>Anyway, I have assembled a complete unattended installation system
from scratch, and I am releasing it here on SourceForge.  Most of the
information here is available elsewhere, but it took me a while to
find because it was not all collected in one place.  I am hoping this
project will save some time for others like myself.  (I would have
found the database of <a href="installers.html">unattended/silent
installer switches for Windows apps</a> particularly handy.)

<h1>What next?</h1>

<p>If you are interested, you can start right now.  First, <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/unattended/">visit the
SourceForge project page</a> to download the distribution.  Or <a
href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/unattended/unattended/">
browse the CVS repository</a>; just click on a revision number to view
the corresponding file.

<p>Next, read the rest of the documentation and follow the
instructions.  The overall process consists of two steps:

<ol>
<li><a href="os.html">Install the operating system</a>
<li><a href="apps.html">Install the applications</a>
</ol>

<p>Step 1 is annoying because it involves DOS networking.

<p>Step 2 is annoying because there is no standard way to install
Windows applications from the command line.  Well, there is, but
nobody uses it.  So every application must be handled specially.
Also, it is tricky to write a script which reboots the machine halfway
through.  (OK, the rebooting part is easy.  But resuming where you
left off is harder.)

<p>And please let me know about any successes, failures, suggestions,
or patches you have.  Thanks!

<p>I was informed and inspired by a few other sites, like these:

<p>Hm, I guess that's the only one.
