<title>Unattended/Silent Installation Switches for Windows Apps</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>This document is part of <a
href="http://unattended.sourceforge.net/">Unattended, a Windows
deployment system</a>.

<hr>
<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>The goal of this document is to collect instructions for performing
unattended/silent installations of many popular Windows applications.
Such instructions are useful for automating these installations.

<p>A quick word on terminology: Strictly speaking, an
<em>unattended</em> installation is one which does not require user
interaction, and a <em>silent</em> (or <em>quiet</em>) installation is
one which does not display any indication of its progress.  However,
most vendors treat these words as synonyms.

<p>Here, we are interested not only in unattended installations, but
also in waiting for the installation to finish and suppressing any
automatic reboot.  These are both necessary to create a system for <a
href="apps.html">reliably installing multiple applications</a>.

<hr>
<h1>General information</h1>

<p>There are several utilities in common use in the Windows world for
creating installers.  Sometimes it will be obvious from the
installer's splash screen which one is in use; sometimes you can
figure it out by running <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/binutils-2.12/html_node/binutils_9.html"
>strings</a>; and sometimes you just have to guess.

<p>Sure, you can run the installer with the <kbd>/?</kbd> switch to
learn which other switches it supports.  But if you really expect this
to work, then you have not been using Windows for very long.  In my
experience, the odds are about 1 in 4 that <kbd>/?</kbd> will tell you
anything at all, even when there is something to tell.

<h2 id="msi">MSI packages</h2>

<p>Microsoft's own <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/techinfo/howitworks/management/installer.asp">Windows
Installer Service</a> is the nominal standard, and if everybody used
it, there would be no need for this document.  Unfortunately,
Microsoft invented it too late.

<p>The package files have a <kbd>.msi</kbd> extension, and you
manipulate them using the <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/TechNet/prodtechnol/winxppro/proddocs/msiexec.asp"
><kbd>msiexec</kbd></a> utility.

<p>For installation, use the <kbd>/i</kbd> and <kbd>/qb</kbd>
switches.  Use the <kbd>/l*</kbd> switch to produce a log file.  You
can provide named options (or "<a
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/msi/setup/properties.asp
">properties</a>") at the end of the command line; which properties
are supported depends on the package.  For example, this command:

<pre>
    msiexec /qb /l* perl-log.txt /i ActivePerl.msi PERL_PATH=Yes PERL_EXT=Yes
</pre>

...is how you install ActiveState Perl, instructing the MSI package to
add Perl.exe to your <code>PATH</code> and to associate
<code>.pl</code> files with it. (<a href="#activeperl">See below</a>
for more on Perl.)

<p><kbd>msiexec</kbd> can do many other things, like uninstall
software or apply patches to existing MSI files.  Neat, huh?  Too bad
nobody uses it.

<h2 id="installshield">InstallShield</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.installshield.com/">InstallShield</a> is one of
the oldest and most widely used application packaging utilities.

<p>Installers created by InstallShield recognize the <kbd>/r</kbd>,
<kbd>/s</kbd>, <kbd>/sms</kbd>, <kbd>/f1</kbd>, and <kbd>/f2</kbd>
switches.  The installer itself is invariably named
<code>setup.exe</code>.

<p>To perform a silent installation, you need an InstallShield "answer
file", customarily named <code>setup.iss</code>.  Some applications
ship with such a file, but if yours does not, you can use the
graphical installer itself to create one.

<p>Here is how it works.  Run the installer with the <kbd>/r</kbd>
("record") switch.  Proceed through the dialogs and complete the
installation.  This will create a <code>setup.iss</code> file and
place it in the <code>C:\WINNT</code> directory (yes, really).  This
file will include all of your responses to the InstallShield dialogs,
allowing you to perform unattended installations as if you were giving
the same answers again.  Simply copy <code>setup.iss</code> to the
same directory as the installer executable.

<p>Once you have a <code>setup.iss</code> file, run the installer with
the <kbd>/s</kbd> ("silent") option.  This will perform an unattended
installation.

<p>Unfortunately, the installer will fork a separate process and exit,
meaning it will return immediately even if you run it under
<kbd>start&nbsp;/wait</kbd>.  This makes it useless for scripting
purposes.  Luckily, there is another switch, <kbd>/sms</kbd>, which
will cause the installer to pause until the installation completes.

<p>Hence, for an InstallShield application, you want to provide both
the <kbd>/s</kbd> and the <kbd>/sms</kbd> switches.

<p>The <kbd>/f1<var>filename</var></kbd> switch allows you to specify
a fully-qualified alternate name for the <code>setup.iss</code> file.
Note that there must be <em>no</em> space between the <kbd>/f1</kbd>
switch and the file name.  This switch works both with <kbd>/r</kbd>
to create the file and with <kbd>/s</kbd> to read it.

<p>The <kbd>/f2<var>filename</var></kbd> switch specifies a log file.
Once again, there must be <em>no</em> space between the switch and the
file name.

<p>WARNING: Be careful what characters you use in these file names,
because InstallShield strips certain non-alphanumerics (like dashes).

<p>Oh, just one more thing.  The <kbd>/r</kbd> and <kbd>/s</kbd>
switches only work if the release engineer is competent.  Many
packages have "custom dialogs" which are not supported by
<code>setup.iss</code>, which means those dialogs will always appear
no matter what you do.  For such packages, I suggest asking the vendor
to fix their installer.  If that does not work, I suggest doing what
you can to help them go out of business.

<h3 id="pftw">PackagefortheWeb</h3>

<p><a href="#installshield">InstallShield</a> has a relatively new
add-on product called <a href="http://www.installshield.com/pftw/"
>PackagefortheWeb</a>, or just PFTW for short.  This is basically an
InstallShield tree bundled up as a single-file executable.

<p>When you run this executable, it extracts a bunch of files to a
temporary directory, then launches the <code>setup.exe</code> within.

<p>The PFTW package recognizes the <kbd>/s</kbd> and
<kbd>/a&nbsp;...</kbd> switches.  The <kbd>/s</kbd> switch instructs
the PFTW package to run silently, although this does not mean that the
underlying <code>setup.exe</code> will run silently.

<p>The <kbd>/a&nbsp;...</kbd> ("add") switch allows you to add
switches to the command line of the underlying <code>setup.exe</code>
process.  You may provide any of the normal InstallShield switches
here, including <kbd>/r</kbd>, <kbd>/s</kbd>, and <kbd>/sms</kbd>.

<p>Thus, to automate the installation of a PFTW package named
<code>foo.exe</code>, you would first perform one installation by hand
to create the answer file:

<pre>
    foo.exe /a /r /f1c:\temp\foo.iss
</pre>

<p>Then, to install the package completely silently, you would run:

<pre>
    start /wait foo.exe /s /a /s /sms /f1c:\temp\foo.iss
</pre>

<p>The first <kbd>/s</kbd> is only needed for a completely silent
installation.  If you leave it off, the PFTW package will show you a
status bar as it extracts the InstallShield tree to the temporary
directory.


<h2 id="wise">Wise InstallMaster</h2>

<p>InstallMaster from <a href="http://www.wise.com/">Wise
Solutions</a> is a competitor to InstallShield.  You can usually
identify the installers it produces by running "strings" on the
executable and grepping for "Wise".

<p>InstallMaster installers are supposed to recognize the
<kbd>/s</kbd> switch to perform a silent installation.  And in my
experience, they generally do.  There is no way to set options.

<p>NOTE: This product has been rebranded the "Wise Installation
System".  Don't let them confuse you.

<h2 id="inno">Inno Setup</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">Inno Setup</a> is an
open source competitor in this space.  You can usually identify the
installers it creates by running "strings" on the executable and
grepping for "Inno".

<p>Inno Setup installers use the <kbd>/silent</kbd> switch for
unattended installations.

<h2 id="hotfixes">Microsoft hotfixes and older packages</h2>

<p>Most Microsoft hotfixes respond to the <kbd>/?</kbd> switch, but
they do not always tell you everything.

<p>Some Microsoft hotfixes use <kbd>/u</kbd> for unattended
installation and <kbd>/z</kbd> to suppress the automatic reboot.
There are other useful switches; use <kbd>/?</kbd> to learn about
them.

<p>Some hotfixes use an old Microsoft packaging technology called
"IExpress", whose switches are more-or-less documented in <a
href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;Q197147">KB
article Q197147</a> and <a
href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=%23DxIcwcQ%24GA.236%40cppssbbsa02.microsoft.com"
>an old USENET post</a>.  These installers first extract themselves to
a temporary folder and then run a command from inside that folder.
They support the <kbd>/t:<var>path</var></kbd> switch, to specify the
temporary folder name, and the <kbd>/c:<var>command</var></kbd> switch
to specify the command to run.  Passing just <kbd>/c</kbd> suppresses
running the command at all, so you can use
<kbd>/c&nbsp;/t:<var>path</var></kbd> to extract the hotfix so you can
look at it.

<p>These packages support the <kbd>/q</kbd> switch for quiet
operation, except sometimes you have to use <kbd>/q:a</kbd> instead.
They also support the <kbd>/r:n</kbd> switch to suppress the reboot.
Sometimes these do not work and you have to fiddle with the
<kbd>/c:<var>command</var></kbd> switch; see the "NOTE" in <a
href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;q317244"
>KB article Q317244</a> for an example.

<p>Leave it to Microsoft to make systems administration an <a
href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;Q69563"
>experimental science</a>.

<h2>If all else fails...</h2>

<p>If the application simply has no unattended installation procedure,
you can create your own.  I prefer to avoid these approaches if at all
possible, since they are relatively unreliable and difficult to
maintain.

<h3 id="repackaging">Repackaging</h3>

<p>There are several tools around which can take a "snapshot" of a
machine's state before and after you perform a manual installation,
compute the differences between the states, and bundle them up as an
"installer".  The <a href="#wise">Wise</a> product line provides good
support for this, and <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/techinfo/planning/management/veritas.asp"
>Microsoft's free tool</a> provides bad support for it.

<p>The main problem with this approach is that it fundamentally cannot
work reliably.  Installers can vary their behavior depending on the
exact initial state of the machine, such as the OS version or the
presence/absence of other installed software.  So the repackaged
installer will almost never do exactly the same thing that a fresh
installation would, unless the target machine is identical to original
machine.

<p>And of course, for every new release of an application, you will
need to perform the repackaging again.

There are other <a
href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;q264478"
>disadvantages</a> which even Microsoft recognizes.

<p>For these reasons, I think repackaging is a very bad idea and I
advise against it.


<h3 id="autoit">AutoIt</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.hiddensoft.com/AutoIt/">AutoIt</a> is a free
tool which can simulate key presses, mouse clicks, etc., following a
script (customarily named with a <code>.aut</code> extension).  Most
installers have a sufficiently simple and consistent interface that a
very short AutoIt script suffices to automate the installation.

<p>The AutoIt distribution comes with very good documentation.  You
can copy the <code>AutoIt.exe</code> program wherever you like (say,
<code>Z:\bin</code>) and invoke it standalone.

<p>AutoIt scripts do have drawbacks.

<p>For one thing, you must be careful when upgrading to new releases
of an application, since the installer's UI may have changed.

<p>More importantly, AutoIt scripts are theoretically unreliable,
because they provide no way to know when a sub-process has exited.
You can tell when the AutoIt executable exits, but that is not the
same thing at all.  For example, an installer's last window might
disappear while the installer still had work to do.  Your master
script, waiting only for the AutoIt executable, would then proceed,
starting another installation or rebooting the machine before the
underlying installer had finished.

<p>AutoIt provides <a
href="http://www.dx21.com/SCRIPTING/AUTOIT/ViewItem.ASP?NTI=4&amp;SI=3&amp;OID=49"
><code>Run</code></a> and <a
href="http://www.dx21.com/SCRIPTING/AUTOIT/ViewItem.ASP?NTI=4&amp;SI=3&amp;OID=50"
><code>RunWait</code></a> primitives, but it does not provide a way to
wait for the termination of an application which was invoked by
<code>Run</code>.  If it did, this race condition could be avoided.

<p>In practice, it does not matter much, because most installers do
finish their work before destroying their last window.  Just make sure
your <code>.aut</code> script uses <a
href="http://www.dx21.com/SCRIPTING/AUTOIT/ViewItem.ASP?NTI=4&amp;SI=3&amp;OID=74"
><code>WinWaitClose</code></a> to wait for that last window to vanish.

<p>To perform unattended installations of Office, you need to create
what Microsoft calls an <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/ork/2000/two/45ct_3.htm"
>"Administrative Installation Point"</a>.  This is basically a copy of
the CD, modified to incorporate your license key and organization
name.  To create the Administrative Installation Point, run:

<pre>
    setup.exe /a data1.msi
</pre>

...from the top-level of the CD-ROM.

<p>You will surely want to apply Microsoft's updates, as well.  You
can keep up with them by reading Microsoft's <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/ork/xp/journ/adminup.htm"
>Administrative Updates Journal</a>.  Note that some updates are not
released with an "administrative" version; for such updates, you will
need to apply them after the installation of Office completes.

<p>You can install Office using the <code>data1.msi</code> package
from the Administrative Installation Point just like any other <a
href="#msi">MSI</a> package.  There are many public properties you can
use, as documented in <a
href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;Q270920">KB
article Q270920</a> (although a better description can be found in the
<code>setupref.xls</code> spreadsheet in the <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/ork/2000/appndx/toolbox.htm#offinfo"
>Office Information</a> download from the Office Resource Kit
toolbox.)  I happen to like the settings <code>ADDLOCAL=ALL</code>,
<code>REBOOT=ReallySuppress</code>, <code>NOUSERNAME=TRUE</code>,
<code>ALLUSERS=1</code>, and <code>DISABLEADVTSHORTCUTS=1</code>.
Your mileage may vary.

<p>Note: To create an Administrative Installation Point, you must be
using the Retail or Enterprise editions of Office 2000 (not OEM).  For
Office XP, only the Enterprise edition will do.  If you try to use the
OEM edition, the process will appear to work, but it will actually
just scribble uselessly over the root directory of the current drive.
(Hint: You can bypass this behavior by using the Office Resource Kit
to create a <em>transform file</em> which changes the
<code>OEMRelease</code> property from 1 to 0, but you did not hear this
from me.)

useless for scripting.  The KB article's instructions for using the
<code>acost.exe</code> tool to configure which components to install
is still accurate, however.

<p>Luckily, by running "strings" on <code>smsinst.exe</code>, we can
learn that all it does is run <code>regedit /s key.dat</code> and then
fire up <code>acmboot.exe</code>.  The <code>key.dat</code> file is
just a simple registry patch to trick <code>acmboot.exe</code> into
thinking that the GUI portion of Setup has already run.  You must
provide the <code>/k</code> switch to <code>acmboot.exe</code> to
specify your license key (sans hyphens).

<p>Having installed Visual C++, you probably want to install the
latest service pack (<a
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/downloads/updates/sp/vs6/sp5/"
>SP5</a> as of this writing).  To perform an unattended installation
of SP5, run <code>setupsp5.exe /qn1</code>.  You may also provide the
<code>/g</code> switch to specify a log file.

<p>But oh, if only it were that simple.  If you are installing on
Windows 2000, you will find that the <code>/qn1</code> flag does not
actually work, because the installer insists on popping up a useless
warning that your version of MDAC is out-of-date.  The solution to
this?  <a href="#mdac">Update MDAC</a> to the latest version before
trying to install the service pack.

<p>So, the full unattended procedure for installing Visual C++ 6.0 is:

<ol>
<li>Run <code>regedit /s key.dat</code>
<li>Run <code>start /wait acmsetup.exe /k <var>license-key</var></code>
<li>Reboot
<li><a href="#mdac">Update MDAC to the latest version</a>
<li>Run <code>start /wait setupsp5.exe /qn1</code>
</ol>

<td>NOTE: The following applies to the April 2002 and October 2002
editions of the MSDN Library.  I make no promises about other
editions, although I would be happy to hear about your experiences
with them.

<p>The good news is that the MSDN Library comes with an <a
href="#msi">MSI</a> package.  The bad news is that when you try to
install it with <code>msiexec</code>, a little dialog box appears
telling you to run the provided <code>setup.exe</code> instead.

<p>Naturally, this <code>setup.exe</code> responds to <kbd>/?</kbd>
with "Incorrect command line parameters", so you have to guess what it
wants.  It turns out that it will take any arguments you give and pass
them on to <code>msiexec</code>.  So we can just run
<code>setup.exe&nbsp;/qb</code> and be done with it, right?  Wrong.
Before running <code>msiexec</code>, <code>setup.exe</code> forks
itself into the background, so <code>start&nbsp;/wait</code> returns
immediately instead of waiting.

<p>But we do not give up so easily.

<p>If you run <code>setup.exe</code> with the
<kbd>/l*v&nbsp;<var>logfile</var></kbd> option, you can learn quite a
bit about what it is doing.  In particular, you can discover that
<code>setup.exe</code> simply passes a <code>SETUP_EXE=yes</code>
property to the underlying <code>msiexec</code> process.

<p>In other words, all you have to do is run
<code>msiexec&nbsp;/qb&nbsp;/i&nbsp;msdn.msi&nbsp;SETUP_EXE=yes</code>,
and the installation proceeds without a hitch.

<p>You may be wondering: If setting one useless property is all
<code>setup.exe</code> does, why does Microsoft want you to use it?
The answer is that the MSDN Library requires IE6, and
<code>setup.exe</code> will install it for you if necessary.  So, you
should make sure you have IE6 installed before you attempt this
procedure, because I have no idea what will happen otherwise.

<p>Incidentally, this will perform a "Default" installation of MSDN
Library, which means that most of the files will not be installed
locally but rather loaded from the source directory as required.  So
choose the path to that <code>msdn.msi</code> package carefully,
because that is the path MSDN will search whenever it needs something.
(Hint: If you would rather perform a "Full" installation so that all
files are copied to the local machine, add
<code>INSTALLATION_TYPE=Full</code> to the command line.)
