This is a list of known bugs, current work and desired improvements.
To make it a little bit accessible, the items are grouped by
subject. In the first column of the line a classification is used to
be able to look for "the next thing to do":

Priority classification:
8   next release
7   as soon as possible
6   soon
5   should be included
4   nice to have
3   consider including
2   maybe not
1   probably not
-   unclassified


-------------------- Known bugs and current work -----------------------

    (Get 1-3 can't update files because protected by windows.)

7   Linux boot always says that possible old bootdisk (No $ENV{'VERSION'}!)

--------------------------- dosboot-disks ------------------------------

6   Initial copying of files works but many times after reboot can't find
    files or just hangs.  Not sure why.  (Maybe something to do with case?)
