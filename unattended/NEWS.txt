*** Changes in version 2.2 (2002-Dec-15)

Alter Makefile to always write .tmp files and rename them into place
when generating images.  This may help some people who have had
trouble regenerating the images, and it is good technique anyway.

Create and document new auconfig.pl script, which provides a
command-line interface to configure Automatic Updates.  Use it in
base.bat.

Add documentation for LeechFTP, NAI Virus Scan, SecureCRT, and
Timbuktu Pro installers (thanks to Trask Rogers).

Add first pass at documentation for OpenOffice.org.  Too bad it
doesn't work, because the installer modifies the current user's
profile instead of the one in "All Users".

Rewrite autolog.pl script.  Now you can use it to set the default
logon name and domain even if you are not configuring automatic logon
itself.

Fix some bugs in install.pl.  Add new [_meta]/autolog parameter to
control invocation of autolog.pl after installation finishes.

Update IE6SP1 and Win2kSP3 hotfixes.


*** Changes in version 2.1 (2002-Nov-10)

Create and document setenv.pl script.  Use it in Cygwin/SSH scripts.

In install.pl, only reboot machine if partition table changes.
Moving ever closer to total non-interaction...

Update win2ksp3-hotfixes.pl.

Add support for Netgear FA311/FA312 network cards.

Fix various minor bugs.

Overhaul documentation for InstallShield.

Import version 2.0 of SYSLINUX binaries.


*** Changes in version 2.0 (2002-Oct-22)

Complete rewrite of install.sh in Perl.  Now it is install.pl, and it
requires that the user install the DJGPP Perl port.  This allows
vastly more flexible site-specific configuration.

If you use version 1.x, you should re-read the OS installation page
(os.html), since it has been rewritten almost from scratch to describe
the new system.

Application installation is unchanged.


*** Changes in version 1.1.2 (2002-Oct-02)

Fix handling of "run fdisk interactively" option.

Remove "TargetPath=\WINNT" because it is redundant, and because it is
not actually the default for XP.

Rewrite startup-type.pl to use WMI interface instead of hacking
registry directly.


*** Changes in version 1.1.1 (2002-Oct-01)

Add and document Z_PATH environment variable for todo.pl.

Create and document shutdown.pl.

Add MSDN library to installers.html and create msdn.bat script.


*** Changes in version 1.1.0 (2002-Sep-30)

Create and document install/site directory.

Add and document .ignore-err directive to todo.pl.

Change todo.pl line endings from \n to \r\n.

Update hotfixes in sample scripts.


*** Changes in version 1.04 (2002-Sep-28)

Rewrite lots of documentation.


*** Changes in version 1.03 (2002-Sep-27)

Add all current hotfixes to winxpsp1-updates.bat.


*** Changes in version 1.02 (2002-Sep-27)

Create winxpsp1-updates.bat script, which installs hotfixes for
Windows XP Sevice Pack 1.

Add more documentation for install.sh script.

Rewrite "add domain accounts to local Administrators group" section of
install.sh.
