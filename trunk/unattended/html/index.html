<title>Unattended, A Windows deployment system</title>

<i>The two basic principles of Windows system administration:</i>
<ul>
<li><i>For minor problems, reboot</i>
<li><i>For major problems, reinstall</i>
</ul>

<h1>What is this?</h1>

<p>This is a system for fully automating the installation of Windows
2000 and XP workstations, including the OS, hotfixes, and
applications.

<p>Features include:
<ul>
<li>Full documentation and source code
<li>Support for floppy, CD-ROM, and "nothing but net" installs
<li>True unattended installation, <b>not</b> disk imaging
<li>No Windows servers required; use your Unix servers instead
<li>No Unix servers required; use your Windows servers after all
<li>Completely free
</ul>

<p>But be warned: This is not a
<kbd>./configure&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;make&nbsp;install</kbd> kind of
project, and it is not a slick GUI app.  You will need to understand
at least a little of what goes on "under the covers", and you will
need to perform some customization for your site.

<h1>Where did it come from?</h1>

<p>In my (often reluctant) experience with Windows, I have found that
the more recently a machine was installed, the better it works.  So I
went searching for ways to make the installation process routine.

<p>This led me into the strange and quirky world of DOS networking,
<code>.bat</code> scripts, <code>unattend.txt</code> files, network
booting, and the amazingly under-documented silent installation
procedures for various Windows applications.

<p>Microsoft has their own solution to this problem, involving things
like <a
href="http//:www.microsoft.com/windows2000/technologies/directory/ad/"
>"Active Directory"</a> and <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/en/datacenter/help/sag_RIS_Default_topnode.htm">"RIS"</a>
and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/smserver/">"SMS"</a>.  I
consider those technologies too heavyweight and complex, so this
system does not depend on them.

<p>Some approaches to this problem involve drive imaging (also known
as "cloning").  This system is not one of them.  Workstation cloning
has several drawbacks, including <a
href="http://service2.symantec.com/SUPPORT/ghost.nsf/docid/1999050308324125"
>the SID issue</a>, poor support for non-uniform hardware, poor
maintainability, and large, bulky images.  Even small hardware
variations, or small updates to the software configuration, can create
large headaches.  On the other hand, if you need to crank out many
workstations with completely identical hardware, drive imaging is both
simple and fast.  And products like <a
href="http://www.symantec.com/sabu/ghost/">Ghost</a> and <a
href="http://www.powerquest.com/driveimage/">Drive&nbsp;Image</a> make
it quite easy.

<p>Anyway, I assembled my own complete unattended installation system
from scratch, and I am releasing it here on SourceForge.  Most of the
information in these pages is available elsewhere, but it took me a
while to find because it was not all collected in one place.  I am
hoping this project will save time for others like myself.  (I would
have found the database of <a href="installers.html">unattended/silent
installer switches for Windows apps</a> particularly handy.)

<h1>What next?</h1>

<p>If you are interested, you can start right now.  First, visit the
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=62053"
>download page</a> to download the distribution.  Each release has two
components: The main distribution
(<code>unattended-<var>version</var>.tar.gz</code>), and the pre-built
disk images
(<code>unattended-images-<var>version</var>.tar.gz</code>).  If you
have a Unix machine with the right tools, you can build the disk
images from the main distribution; but for now, you should probably
just download both and extract them to the same folder.

<p>Next, read the rest of this documentation.  The overall process
consists of two steps:

<ol>
<li><a href="os.html">Install the operating system.</a> This step is
annoying because it involves DOS networking.

<li><a href="apps.html">Install the applications.</a> This step is
annoying because there is no standard way to install Windows
applications from the command line.  Well, there is, but nobody uses
it.  So every application must be handled specially.  Also, it is
tricky to write a script which reboots the machine halfway through.
(OK, the rebooting part is easy.  But resuming where you left off is
harder.)
</ol>

<p>Note that these steps describe the process which we are automating.
Once you finish the preparatory work, the actual process of installing
a workstation will be 1)&nbsp;Boot from floppy, CD, or network;
2)&nbsp;Answer some questions; 3)&nbsp;Have a cup of tea.

<p>This system is still relatively new, so do not be surprised or
dismayed if you encounter problems.  Just use the links on the <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/unattended/" >project page</a>
to submit a bug report or feature request.  Developers might be
interested in browsing <a
href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/unattended/unattended/">
the CVS repository</a>; just click on a revision number to view the
corresponding file.  I am looking for co-developers; contact me if you
are interested.

<p>And in any event, please <a
href="mailto:patl@users.sourceforge.net">let me know</a> what you
think; user feedback is my primary motivation.  Thanks!
