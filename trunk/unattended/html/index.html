<i>The two basic principles of Windows system administration:</i>
<ul>
<li><i>For minor problems, reboot</i>
<li><i>For major problems, reinstall</i>
</ul>

<h1>What is this?</h1>
<p>This project is for Unix system administrators living in a Windows
world.  It will show you how to use your Unix servers to let you boot
from a floppy (or CD-ROM, or directly from the network), answer a few
questions, and come back two hours later to a fully-installed Windows
workstation.

<p>Be warned: This is not a <tt>./configure && make install</tt> kind
of project.  This is a set of instructions, tools, and examples which
must be customized for your site.  Nevertheless, here you will find
everything you need or a reference to it.  Well, that is my intention,
anyway.

<h1>Where did it come from?</h1>

<p>In my (reluctant) experience with Windows, I have found that
freshly-installed systems just work better.  I decided to research
automating the installation process.

<p>This led me into the strange and quirky world of DOS networking,
.bat scripts, unattended.txt files, PXE (network) booting, and the
myriad different "silent" installation procedures for Windows
applications.

<p>Most of this information is available elsewhere, but to my
knowledge it is not all collected in one place.  By creating such a
place, I figure maybe I can save others like myself some time.
