<i>The two basic principles of Windows system administration:</i>
<ul>
<li><i>For minor problems, reboot</i>
<li><i>For major problems, reinstall</i>
</ul>

<h1>What is this?</h1>
<p>This is a project for Unix systems administrators living in a
Windows world.  It will teach you how to boot from a floppy (or
CD-ROM, or directly from the network), answer a few questions, and
come back two hours later to a fully-installed Windows workstation,
using nothing but Unix servers on the back end.

<p>But be warned: This is not a
<tt>./configure&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;make&nbsp;install</tt> kind of
project.  This is a set of instructions, tools, and sample scripts
which will require some customization for your site.  Nevertheless,
everything you need to know, or at least a reference to it, is here
somewhere.  If not, let me know; all suggestions and contributions are
welcome.

<h1>Where did it come from?</h1>

<p>In my (ever reluctant) experience with Windows, I have found that
the more recently a machine was installed, the better it tends to
work.  So I decided to look for ways to make the installation process
routine.

<p>This led me into the strange and quirky world of DOS networking,
.bat scripts, unattended.txt files, network booting, and the
astoundingly under-documented "silent" installation procedures for
various Windows applications.

<p>Microsoft has their own solutions to these problems, involving
things like <a
href="http//:www.microsoft.com/windows2000/technologies/directory/ad/"
>"Active Directory"</a> and <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/en/datacenter/help/sag_RIS_Default_topnode.htm">"RIS"</a>
and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/smserver/">"SMS"</a>.  If you
think those sound like good ideas, then you are not part of my
intended audience.

<p>Anyway, I put together a complete system from scratch and I am
releasing it here on SourceForge.  Most of the content here is also
available elsewhere, but it took me a while to find because it was not
all collected in one place.  I am hoping that by creating such a
place, I can save others like myself some time.

<h1>What next?</h1>

<p>If you are interested, you can start right now.  First, <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/unattended/">visit the
SourceForge project page</a> to download the distribution.  (Or <a
href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/unattended/unattended/">
browse the CVS repository</a>.  Click on a revision number to view the
corresponding file.)

<p>Next, educate yourself about the overall process.  It consists of
two steps:

<ol>
<li><a href="os.html">Install the operating system</a>
<li><a href="apps.html">Install the applications</a>
</ol>

<p>Step 1 is annoying because it involves DOS network drivers.

<p>Step 2 is annoying because there is no standard way to install
Windows applications from the command line.  (Well, there is, but
almost nobody uses it.)  So every application must be handled
specially.  Also, it is tricky to write a script which reboots the
machine halfway through.  (OK, so rebooting is pretty easy.  But
automatically picking up where you left off is another matter.)
