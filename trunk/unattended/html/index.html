<i>The two basic principles of Windows system administration:</i>
<ul>
<li><i>For minor problems, reboot</i>
<li><i>For major problems, reinstall</i>
</ul>

<h1>What is this?</h1>
<p>This is a project for Unix systems administrators living in a
Windows world.  It will teach you how to boot from a floppy, CD-ROM,
or directly from the network, answer a few questions, and come back
two hours later to a fully installed Windows workstation.

<p>But be warned: This is not a
<kbd>./configure&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;make&nbsp;install</kbd> kind of
project.  This is a set of instructions, tools, and sample scripts
which will require some customization for your site.  Nevertheless,
everything you need to know, or at least a reference to it, is here
somewhere.  If not, let me know; all suggestions and contributions are
welcome.

<h1>Where did it come from?</h1>

<p>In my (ever reluctant) experience with Windows, I have found that
the more recently a machine was installed, the better it works.  So I
decided to look for ways to make the installation process routine.

<p>This led me into the strange and quirky world of DOS networking,
<code>.bat</code> scripts, <code>unattend.txt</code> files, network
booting, and the amazingly under-documented silent installation
procedures for various Windows applications.

<p>Microsoft has their own solution to this problem, involving things
like <a
href="http//:www.microsoft.com/windows2000/technologies/directory/ad/"
>"Active Directory"</a> and <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/en/datacenter/help/sag_RIS_Default_topnode.htm">"RIS"</a>
and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/smserver/">"SMS"</a>.  Because
of the nature of my infrastructure, and some personal biases, this
project does not rely on any of them.  You can certainly use Windows
servers if you like; I myself use this procedure to join workstations
to our Windows domain, for instance.  But you do not need them.

<p>Some approaches to this problem involve drive imaging (also known
as "cloning").  This project is not one of them.  Workstation cloning
has several drawbacks, including <a
href="http://service2.symantec.com/SUPPORT/ghost.nsf/docid/1999050308324125"
>the SID issue</a>, poor support for non-uniform hardware, poor
maintainability, and large, bulky images.  Even small hardware
variations, or small updates to the software configuration, can create
large headaches.  On the other hand, if you need to crank out many
workstations with completely identical hardware, drive imaging is both
simple and fast.  And products like <a
href="http://www.symantec.com/sabu/ghost/">Ghost</a> and <a
href="http://www.powerquest.com/driveimage/">Drive&nbsp;Image</a> make
it quite easy.

<p>Anyway, I have assembled a complete unattended installation system
from scratch, and I am releasing it here on SourceForge.  Most of the
information here is available elsewhere, but it took me a while to
find because it was not all collected in one place.  I am hoping this
project will save time for others like myself.  (I would have found
the database of <a href="installers.html">unattended/silent installer
switches for Windows apps</a> particularly handy.)

<h1>What next?</h1>

<p>If you are interested, you can start right now.  First, visit the
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/unattended/">SourceForge
project page</a> to download the distribution.  Or <a
href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/unattended/unattended/">
browse the CVS repository</a>; just click on a revision number to view
the corresponding file.

<p>Next, read the rest of the documentation and follow the
instructions.  The overall process consists of two steps:

<ol>
<li><a href="os.html">Install the operating system</a>
<li><a href="apps.html">Install the applications</a>
</ol>

<p>Step 1 is annoying because it involves DOS networking.

<p>Step 2 is annoying because there is no standard way to install
Windows applications from the command line.  Well, there is, but
nobody uses it.  So every application must be handled specially.
Also, it is tricky to write a script which reboots the machine halfway
through.  (OK, the rebooting part is easy.  But resuming where you
left off is harder.)

<p>Note that this project is still in its testing stage, so do not be
surprised if you encounter problems.  Please use the links on the <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/unattended/" >project page</a>
to submit bug reports and feature requests.

<p>And please <a href="mailto:patl@users.sourceforge.net">let me
know</a> what you think.  Thanks!
