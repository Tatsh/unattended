<title>Unattended, A Windows deployment system: FAQ</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>This document is part of <a
href="http://unattended.sourceforge.net/" >Unattended, a Windows
deployment system</a>.


<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>The main Unattended documentation is perpetually out-of-date.  It
is still mostly accurate, but it is incomplete because we tend to add
new features without updating the docs.

<p>Someday I (or somebody) will crack and rewrite the documentation
from scratch.  Until then, this page will have to suffice.  It is
partly a FAQ, and partly just a collection of pointers to bits of
wisdom from the <a
href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/unattended-info/"
>unattended-info mailing list</a>.

<h1 id="linux">Did you say "Linux boot disk"?</h1>

<p>Why, yes, I did.

<p>Traditionally, Unattended had you boot to DOS to start the
installation of Windows.  And most of our documentation was written
with this approach in mind.

<p>It works fine, usually, but DOS has certain <a
href="http://www.mail-archive.com/unattended-info@lists.sourceforge.net/msg01030.html"
>limitations</a> which we can avoid by using Linux.  If you do not
care, then feel free to continue using the old boot disk.

<p>Starting with Unattended 4.0, we are shipping a Linux boot disk in
addition to the DOS boot disk.  Note that this is not for installing
Linux; we are simply booting a custom diskless Linux system to
initiate the installation of Windows.  The Linux boot disk is very new
and our documentation has not been updated for it, but it works a lot
like the DOS boot disk.  It runs the same Perl code, in fact, which we
think is kind of neat.  At present, it only supports booting from
CD-ROM (using the <code>linuxboot/linuxboot.iso</code> image) or
network (using the <code>linuxboot/tftpboot</code> tree).

<p>You can upgrade a pre-4.0 version of Unattended to use the Linux
boot disk by just <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=7558008"
>copying some new stuff</a> to the <code>Z:</code> drive.

<p>If you are booting from the network, you can <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=7558006">edit
pxelinux.cfg/default</a> to override the bootdisk defaults
(<code>Z:</code> share, username, password).

<p>The boot disk uses Linux kernel 2.6.4, whose hardware support is
still maturing.  We are interested in your success/failure reports;
please send them to <a
href="mailto:unattended-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">unattended-devel</a>.

<h1>Can I use Cygwin to rebuild the disk images on Windows?</h1>

<p>For the DOS boot disk, <a href="cygwin.html">yes</a>.

<p>For the Linux boot disk, no.  Probably not, anyway.

<h1>Can I boot from a USB stick?</h1>

<p>Yes.  Er, maybe.  Probably.  (coming soon)

<h1>Can I install over a wireless LAN?</h1>

<p><a
href="http://www.mail-archive.com/unattended-info@lists.sourceforge.net/msg00212.html"
>Yes</a>, with the help of a commercial product.

<p>Adding wireless support to our (free) DOS boot disk would be
difficult, because as far as I know, there are no wireless drivers for
DOS.

<p>Adding wireless support to our Linux boot disk is a Simple Matter
of Programming, at least for the wireless devices which Linux
supports.  Call it a "to-do" item.  The hard part is designing and
implementing an interface to let the user set the wireless parameters
(like ESSID).  If you would like to help tackle this, subscribe to the
<a
href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/unattended-devel/"
>unattended-devel mailing list</a> and ask what's up.

<h1>Can I install Windows NT?</h1>

<p><a
href="http://www.mail-archive.com/unattended-info@lists.sourceforge.net/msg01211.html"
>Not right now</a>. Patches are welcome.

<h1>Can I install Windows 95/98/ME? </h1>

<p>No, and I think this would be hard.  <a
href="http://www.mail-archive.com/unattended-info%40lists.sourceforge.net/msg01135.html"
>Some interest</a> has been expressed on the mailing list.

<h1>Can I use a serial console?</h1>

<p>This should be possible using either boot disk.  See <a
href="http://www.mail-archive.com/unattended-info@lists.sourceforge.net/msg01156.html"
>this thread</a> on the mailing list.

<h1>Can I install from DVD-ROM instead of a network share?</h1>

<p>We are interested in adding support for this.  See <a
href="http://www.mail-archive.com/unattended-info@lists.sourceforge.net/msg01052.html">this
thread</a> from the mailing list, especially <a
href="http://www.mail-archive.com/unattended-info%40lists.sourceforge.net/msg01174.html">this
followup</a> from Pablo Manzanera.  Patches are welcome...

<h1>Why do you always install IIS?</h1>

<p><a
href="http://www.mail-archive.com/unattended-info@lists.sourceforge.net/msg01130.html"
>We have reasons</a>. You can always disable it in unattend.txt.

<h1>How do I enable Windows XP' Internet Connection Firewall?</h1>

<p>The instructions for this are somewhat confusing, and I have not
yet had time to try them myself.  The question <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=7556124">comes
up</a> on the mailing list from time to time.

<p>Searching for <code>[Homenet]</code> and
<code>InternetConnectionFirewall</code> on Google <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?q=homenet+internetconnectionfirewall">Web</a>
and <a
href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=homenet+internetconnectionfirewall">Groups</a>
turns up some slightly contradictory information.

<h1>How do I disable sound?</h1>

<p>See <a
href="http://www.mail-archive.com/unattended-info@lists.sourceforge.net/msg01050.html"
>this thread</a> from the mailing list.

<h1>Is FAT -> NTFS conversion a bad idea?</h1>

<p>As Microsoft describes in "<a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/hwdev/tech/storage/ntfs-preinstall.mspx"
>NTFS Preinstallation and Windows XP</a>", FAT&nbsp;->&nbsp;NTFS
conversion normally results in a file system with 512-byte clusters
and a fragmented Master File Table (MFT).

<p>With Windows XP, Microsoft provides two tools (OFORMAT and CVTAREA)
to address these problems.  <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=7202531"
>I asked</a> the FreeDOS folks about running OFORMAT under FreeDOS,
and <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=7094304"
>they responded</a> by adding a switch (<code>/a</code>) to FreeDOS
FORMAT which does the same thing.  Unattended now uses this switch, so
we get a 4K cluster size after NTFS conversion, at least on Windows XP
and Server 2003.

<p>Using CVTAREA is on the "to-do" list.

<p>That said, I and others have installed hundreds of machines without
using OFORMAT nor CVTAREA, and they work fine.
